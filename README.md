### My annotated library
I am not a fan of Mendeley, though I value the tool, but I dont like to click twice to see the annotation and, generally speaking, find myself not reading articles i add to mendeley too often, i've decided to create my own one here... with some sorta dataset which i might work with somehow later on idk. </br>
feel free to read, if you found it somehow </br>
Notice that everything i write is for personal use so pay no attention if there is anything confusing or rude </br>
articles_neuromorphic.md contains citations and descriptions of scientific articles i've read </br>
