DOI: doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.05.011
Publisher: Elsevier
Open access: yes
Purpose: frog (anura) retina review
Pros: 203 references
Cons: not much of an explaination
Methods used: literature
Description: starts with some advanced info regarding pigments, then briefly about electroretinography and visually-guided behavior. A bit of pictures
Opinion: i found it difficult to read. However, includes a lot of useful references, which makes this article useful itself

Name: The hawk/goose story: the classical ethological experiments of Lorenz and Tinbergen, revisited
Journal: Journal of Comparative Psychology
Volume: 125(2), 121-33
DOI: doi.org/10.1037/a0022068
Publisher: APA
Open access: scihub
Purpose: ethology, vision
Pros: cool effect, different iterations of study described
Cons: No electrophysiology
Methods used: literature review, ethology, dummies, idk what it is all called
Description: the story behind hawk/goose effect, well described. It appears that not the exact pattern is important after all - it is more about rarity of specific dynamic pattern, including same object moving in opposite directions. Then some psychological stuff went on so I stopped reading tbh
Opinion: Quite useful to know

Journal: Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology
Volume: 106, 61–71
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2020.04.010
Publisher: Elsevier
Open access: yes
Purpose: salamander vision review
Pros: simple, comprehensive, tons of sources
Cons: none
Methods used: patch-clamp, electrode array, etc etc
Description: a comprehensive review on salamander vision system - some historical background, retina features (including comparison of photoreceptors between species, and some properties of photoreceptors themselves), a bit of higher levels of vision. Contains a lot of useful references. Some info about dynamic patterns as well, but not too much. Might need to check the sources they refer to - authors briefly dedscribed an experiment where salamanders vision had been reversed by rotating eyes
Opinion: interesting, even entertaining. An excellent paper, and very useful

Name: Effect of 180 degree rotation of the retinal field on Visuomotor Coordination
Journal: Journal of Experimental Zoology
Volume: 92(3), 263–279
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jez.1400920303
Publisher: Wiley
Open access: scihub
Purpose: vision
Pros: comprehensive descriptions, ethology, experimental design, effect itself is important
Cons: no electrophysiology (who wouldda thought), difficult language
Methods used: surgery
Description: newts' retinas were rotated 180 degrees. There were different experimental groups, but in general such details are not that essential (control group was blind). Briefly, their optokinetics was reversed, and remained the same during 4.5 months of observation. Meanwhile, control group managed to adapt, thanks to other perceptual systems (like olfactory and shit). There's also some info about morphological changes (their skin color), but it doesnt seem relevant to me. More detes in the article.
Opinion: interesting that there was lack of plasticity. I wonder if there are any similar researches

Name: Visuomotor coordination in the newt (triturus viridescens) after regeneration of the optic nerve

Volume: 79(1), 33–55
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.900790104
Publisher: Wiley
Open access: scihub
Purpose: vision
Pros: comprehensive descriptions, ethology, experimental design, effect itself is important, huge discussion
Cons: no electrophysiology (who wouldda thought), difficult language
Methods used: surgery
Description: Continuation of [5], except this time optic nerve was cut. It regenerated (links to previous works in the article), but newts vision was still reversed. Contains huge discussion part
Opinion: Now I wonder if there is anything like that done on primates, or any revisits of this work in terms of systems neuroscience
