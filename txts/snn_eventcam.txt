Name: Sign language gesture recognition and classification based on event camera with spiking neural networks
Journal: Electronics
Volume: 12(4), 786
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics12040786
Publisher: MDPI
Open access: yes
Purpose: gesture recognition
Pros: explainations, event-based datasets info
Cons: low biological realism
Methods used: STBP, LIF, SGD, CELoss, SNN, CNN, v2e, DVS, Freq coding, Events, Pytorch
Description: Authours state that using traditional CNN methods require event data to become frame-based, like RGB data, which is a significant drawback - lost of asynchronous data benefits, which is one the main reasons of event-based vision to exist. They've investigated some sign language datasets and created their own event collection with DAVIS346 camera. STBP method was used to train an SNN. The article contains a fairly simple explaination of the algorithm underlying the principle of event-camera. Dataset was created using v2e method + DAVIS346 for better validation - 64 classes (verbs and nouns). The model - LIF-based conv SNN, freq coding, trained with STBP (spatio-temporal backprobagation) algorithm. They used pool, conv, LIF and fc in the architecture (not quite biologically realistic, obviously). Literally, LIF layers serve as temporally assymetrical ReLU. Description of the whole work is quite comprehensive, including v2e explaination, so it might be easy to reproduce. The model is built with Pytorch, optimized with SGD. Somehow, v2e shows better accuracy, compared with native event recordings (77% and 68%, respectively).
Opinion: 2/3-gen NNs - not the approach i'm looking for. Still, some info might come in handy

Name: Event-based optical flow estimation with spatio-temporal backpropagation trained spiking neural network
Journal: Micromachines
Volume: 14(1), 203
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14010203 
Publisher: MDPI
Open access: yes
Purpose: optical flow estimation
Pros: slicing methods
Cons: backpropagation
Methods used: STBP, SNN, DVS, Events, Event slicing, LIF, Self-supervised learning, Pytorch, Adam, AEE
Description: The idea of the paper is to introduce an SNN for discrete spatio-temporal stream of events (basically, slices of events), reducing the amount of computation (the also show the slicing method (their own, but from previous work - doi.org/10.3390/s22072614). As far as i've understood, the method is sensitive to amount of events, the more events - the shorter the slice. But i kinda doubt it, regarding their equation. Haven't dug the topic yet, so you better check it out yourself). For self-supervised learning they generate grayscale image with the event stream. The model is an autoencoder, implemented with Pytorch and trained with Adam optimizer. Authors also provide benchmarks for computational costs and prediction results with different slicing methods.
Opinion: So far, this work seems questionable to me. Perhaps it is because i'm new to event cameras, but i see no reason to divide a single slice of data into two channels (ON/OFF) just to feed the first one-channel layer of the same size.
