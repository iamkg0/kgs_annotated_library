### My annotated library
I am not a fan of Mendeley, though I value the tool, but I dont like to click twice to see the annotation and, enerally speaking, find myself not reading articles i add to mendeley too often, i've decided to create my own one here... with some sorta dataset which i might work with somehow later on idk. </br>
feel free to read, if you somehow found it </br>
Notice that everything i write is my kinda opinion so no offense if there is anything confusing or rude </br>
Readme contains citations and my descriptions of articles i've read </br>
